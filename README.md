# ML-Project----Predicting-the-melting-points-of-organic-compounds
A graded NTU mini project on using RDkit function to build a linear model to predict the melting points of organic compounds. 

SMILES and melting point data were obtained from Bradley J-C, Williams A, Lang A. Jean-Claude Bradley open melting point dataset. 2014, http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1031637.v2. 

To note, the codes were written in conjunction with Yee Sheun and Carl.

This repository mainly consists of the melting point dataset, codes in jupyter notebook, a powerpoint slide explaining the techniques that was used.
